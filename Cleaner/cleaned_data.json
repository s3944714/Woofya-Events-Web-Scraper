        "description": "If your dog is a beach lover then this walk is for you. Hugging the Kiama coastline down to Gerringong, this full-day adventure will take you past Cathedral Rocks, the Kiama Blowhole and Bombo Headland. There are also a bunch of spots your pooch can cool off in the water including Werri and Bombo beaches. If 20km is a little too long, consider a shorter section of the hike – the north, mid or south – which are around five-to-eight kilometres each. Dog-friendly hikes in the Blue Mountains are more common than you may think despite the surrounding Blue Mountains National Park (dogs are forbidden in national parks). The short-but-sweet Katoomba Falls Reserve Night-lit walk welcomes dogs and offers a unique experience for owners and pets alike. Come dusk, flood and path lights are switched on to illuminate an otherwise pitch-black path and rock formations, enabling visitors to experience the outstanding natural wonders at sunset and beyond. Go bush in the middle of the city with this peaceful track in Parramatta. The Lake Parramatta circuit captures all three of the lake’s short walks into a cumulative 4km trail where you’ll encounter local birds, frogs and lizards; you can even hop in the lake for a swim from October into the summer months. There are also several stepping-stone-like pathways your four-legged friend is sure to enjoy leaping over. If you’re a keen hiker and camper, and are itching to bring your furry friend along for the adventure, this hike is for you. While the Hume and Hovell track is an epic 426km trail spanning Yass to Albury, passing through national parks, the section from Paddys River Dam to Buddong Hut is in Bago State Forest and therefore dog-friendly. Embark on this one- or two-night adventure with your pooch and enjoy wildlife encounters, vast forest and bushland, bridge crossings and creeks. This full-day hike brings together most of the walking trails in the Strickland State Forest and will transport you to scenes from Jurassic Park, with lush forest, views overlooking the canopy and trickling streams. Hit this dog-friendly trail and enjoy your walk listening to birdsong and if you’re lucky, you may even see a wallaby or goanna. The out-and-back coastal trail in Forster is as picturesque as they come. Beginning at the ocean bath at Forster’s main beach and heading south to One Mile, this trail passes many points of interest including Pebbly Beach and coastal rocky outcrops. Keep an eye out for views of Nine Mile Beach and Booti Booti National Park, and signage for the off-leash areas where your pooch can roam free. This dog-friendly hike just outside of Blackheath in the Blue Mountains is a hidden gem – it’s close to the national park, but not part of it, so it feels one and the same. On this trail you’ll pass rocky cliffsides, walk through canyons and head up and down flights of stairs, plus there’s lush rainforest and classic Australian bushland. While the track is well-marked and maintained, it may be best suited to more experienced and agile dogs that are able to keep their footing. Remember: Be mindful of others when walking your dog and be sure to observe the etiquette of responsible dog ownership in public spaces. Take care to check signage for details of on- and off-leash areas, as these may differ from location to location. Clean up after your dog and leave no trace. Stay safe when hiking and walking in New South Wales. Plan ahead and check walk/hike and local council websites for alerts and closures before commencing.",

Go bush in the middle of the city with this peaceful track in Parramatta. The Lake Parramatta circuit captures all three of the lake’s short walks into a cumulative 4km trail where you’ll encounter local birds, frogs and lizards; you can even hop in the lake for a swim from October into the summer months. There are also several stepping-stone-like pathways your four-legged friend is sure to enjoy leaping over. If you’re a keen hiker and camper, and are itching to bring your furry friend along for the adventure, this hike is for you. While the Hume and Hovell track is an epic 426km trail spanning Yass to Albury, passing through national parks, the section from Paddys River Dam to Buddong Hut is in Bago State Forest and therefore dog-friendly. Embark on this one- or two-night adventure with your pooch and enjoy wildlife encounters, vast forest and bushland, bridge crossings and creeks. This full-day hike brings together most of the walking trails in the Strickland State Forest and will transport you to scenes from Jurassic Park, with lush forest, views overlooking the canopy and trickling streams. Hit this dog-friendly trail and enjoy your walk listening to birdsong and if you’re lucky, you may even see a wallaby or goanna. The out-and-back coastal trail in Forster is as picturesque as they come. Beginning at the ocean bath at Forster’s main beach and heading south to One Mile, this trail passes many points of interest including Pebbly Beach and coastal rocky outcrops. Keep an eye out for views of Nine Mile Beach and Booti Booti National Park, and signage for the off-leash areas where your pooch can roam free. This dog-friendly hike just outside of Blackheath in the Blue Mountains is a hidden gem – it’s close to the national park, but not part of it, so it feels one and the same. On this trail you’ll pass rocky cliffsides, walk through canyons and head up and down flights of stairs, plus there’s lush rainforest and classic Australian bushland. While the track is well-marked and maintained, it may be best suited to more experienced and agile dogs that are able to keep their footing. Remember: Be mindful of others when walking your dog and be sure to observe the etiquette of responsible dog ownership in public spaces. Take care to check signage for details of on- and off-leash areas, as these may differ from location to location. Clean up after your dog and leave no trace. Stay safe when hiking and walking in New South Wales. Plan ahead and check walk/hike and local council websites for alerts and closures before commencing.",
